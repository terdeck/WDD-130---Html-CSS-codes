        Conceptual Book Cover
        I was tasked with creating three different book cover variations for the same classic novel. The three cover variations were classified as:
        Typography Cover - A cover that solely uses typography to convey the meaning or message behind the book. 
        Handmade Cover - A cover that is made from physical materials. 
        Designer's Choice Cover - A cover that could be developed in any style or format as long as it employs a creative design strategy.
        I chose to base my project on "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by Baroness Emmuska Orczy which was printed in 1905 after originally being produced as a play in 1903.
        Type Poster
        The goal of this project was to create a poster for a typeface of our choosing to be used as an advertisement showing off its specific qualities. This poster would then be used to entice other designers to purchase the font, in this case, from fonts.com. I included background information about the typeface, the original designer Giambattisa Bodoni, and an example of the different weights offered.
        Business Card 
        I was tasked with creating a business card for my own brand that could be used professionally and focused solely on typography. By using design principles and a strict grid system, I was able to achieve a professional and elegant business card with a hint of whimsy.
        Theater Poster
        The goal of this project was to create symbol and typography posters for a Shakespeare theater production. I chose the play, Macbeth. For the first poster, I converted a photograph I took into an image trace. The second poster captures Macbeth's descent into madness after committing the murders. The third poster is an ambigram I designed for the quote ‘Fair is Foul and Foul is Fair’.
        Pamphlet
        The purpose of this assignment was to create a pamphlet that could be gifted focusing on a talk of our choosing from the October 2022 LDS General Conference. Typography and layout design were the most important aspects of this unit. We were to use as little graphic influences as possible so all of the attention could be on the different typographical components and the message being presented. I chose to use Elder D. Todd Christofferson's talk titled The Doctrine of Belonging.
        Ad Campaign - Nonliteral
        This project involved creating a non-literal magazine ad for a randomly generated household item. My object was toilet paper. I immediately thought of the Charmin toilet paper brand with its catchy jingles and oh-so-soft bath tissue. 
        Logo Design
        When this project was assigned, I immediately fell in love. The purpose was to develop a logo for a fictional shop of our choice with an animal mascot. I created the fictional boba tea shop ‘Bubble Panda’ and decided to use a Red Panda as my mascot. This project was so much fun and I had an absolute blast designing this logo. 
        Ad Campaign - Existing
        This ad was created to mimic an existing ad campaign. I chose Barilla Pasta because I love the creativity and playfulness of their seasonal ads.
