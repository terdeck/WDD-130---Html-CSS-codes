    <p>My husband and I live with our two pups. I am working on certificates in Graphic Design and Web Development.</p>
    <p>I love being creative and working with different mediums. I like drawing, cooking, gardening, and creating with crochet and perler beads. </p>
    <p>Though I have several favorite colors, I love purple the most. Above is a picture of me with our furbabies Maggie (left) and Lucy (right).</p>
